            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <label>A.</label> God did thereby witneſs to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that it was his which they did preach, by giving them power to work ſuch miracles: Hebrewes 2:4:</p>

               <label>Q</label> Were the people moved by thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to receive their Doctrine?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Yea very many were moved therewith, &amp; wondring at their Miracles beleeved their Doctrine even as many as were ordained to eternall life.</p>

            <p>
               <label>A:</label> Yes certainly, ſuch was the power of their miniſtry that many others beleeved the truth of their Doctrine and were baptized, as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus, and doubtleſs many others which never received the ſpirituall benefit of

            <p>
               <label>A.</label> I muſt be hold to anſwer in the Apoſtls words, that without faith it is unpoſsible to pleaſe God, and that the grounds of faith is a Confidence of things not ſeen, no not for fleſh and blood, Duſt and Aſhes to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, only what Abraham, and Abell, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, and Iacob, and Moſes, and others did beleive only by faith.

               <label>A.</label> The deſtruction of Antechriſt, that man of ſin, the reſtoring of the truth from thoſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors abroad in the world, the coming downe of the ſpirit upon Chriſtians, and the coming of the Lord unto Iudgement. 2 Theſ. 28. Revel. 11.11.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Q</label> Is the time of the deſtruction of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt laid down in the Scriptures?</p>
            <p>

            <p>
               <label>Q</label> But is it poſſible to find out the time of his deſtruction?</p>
            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Yes aſſuredly, for the Lord hath cauſed it to be written for that end, that the Church of God might know it, and might reap the greater comfort thereby, in not only knowing that he ſhall be deſtroyed, but alſo in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the yeare of his deſtruction, they may have their mind ſettled of that promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his deſtruction.</p>

               </gap>s appeareth in the laſt verſe of the 13. Chapter, where the very period, and finall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Antichriſt is laid downe, in which yeare the ddſtruction denounced againſt him ſhall fall on him.</p>
            <p>

               <label>Q</label> Is not the truth fully known, publiſhed, preached, and profeſſed now at this time, in thoſe Kingdomes where Antichriſts power is aboliſhed?</p>

            <p>
               <label>A.</label> Yes aſſuredly, for it is the light of the truth maintained by the ſaints, which ſhall in a ſpeciall manner aboliſh Antichriſts dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and alſo ſhall be the greateſt meanes of his deſtruction, for the people of God ſhall by the light of the truth more fully diſcover his abominations, and cauſe the Princes of the earth to ſee how groſly they have been delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and abuſed by him, and ſo they ſhall with one conſent, ſet themſelves againſt this great enemy of Chriſt to root him out, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Iudgment that the Lord hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced sgainſt him.
